# NOTE 

* Because `ADNIMERGE2` is an R data package with frequent content updates, the change log focuses exclusively on major changes to R functions and package infrastructure rather than routine data refreshes.

# Development

* Fix #21 bugs in `get_required_dataset_list`. Thanks @jwang-lilly.

# ADNIMERGE2 0.1.1

* Initial data package.
